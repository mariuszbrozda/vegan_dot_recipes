Application was tested manually by pretending to be a user and play the game:

- Enter name and using form to log in to the game and test if form requests are sent correctly and user is redirected to game page
    Also if username is passed to the game page(displayed as a player).

- Submit correct answer to test if the point is adding, next riddle is shown, success flash message is shown.

- Submit incorrect answer to test if the next riddle is shown, point's are not added, error flash message is shown 
    and also if the user's wrong answer is displayed in WRONG ANSWER'S board (correct answer in bracket's)

- submit an empty form to test if info flash message is shown and there are no changes in points and riddles redirection.
    Also nothing should be added to WRONG ANSWER boar.

- Tests if after last question, user is added to ranking board, submitt form is disapear and "go to ranking" buttom is displayed

- click "go to ranking" buttom to test if it lead user to game over page.

- click "click to play again" buttom to test if it lead to log in page (index.html)


- Application was also tested by using google developers tools to check it responsiveness for particular screen width,
to check if there are active user's session or if there are errors 

- Project responsiveness was tested by google developer tools where it was resising to particular device size(for example iphones,samsung )
It was tested also by changing size of browser window and by opening application on diferent types of devices(Iphone 5s, Iphone XR, Huawei).
I chose Desktop first approach because percentage of users using website will be using PC's.
Application looks good on all screen sizes but works best on the large and medium screen size. On small sizes pages  
Application was tested after each functionality was added to it.
